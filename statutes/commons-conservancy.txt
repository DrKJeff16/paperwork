Purpose
=======

The ToS;DR Programme (in short: ToS;DR) has been established to
facilitate an open, transparent and efficient governance process
throughout the future development of the technology and auxiliary
materials (such as documentation, tests, validators and tutorials)
developed within the ToS;DR user and development community.

ToS;DR seeks to provide guidance, oversight and coordination of
activities as well as a long-term, multi-stakeholder and architectural
perspective.

Legal Status
============

ToS;DR is the name of a not-for-profit technical and creative
community effort serving the public benefit. ToS;DR is established
as a Programme within The Commons Conservancy. The Commons
Conservancy is a not-for-profit foundation ('Stichting') established
under The Netherlands law.

Terms contained in this document refer to the respective definitions of
these terms within the regulations of The Commons Conservancy, unless
explicitly noted otherwise. The Programme is subject to the conditions
set forth in the Statutes and Regulations of The Commons Conservancy,
more in particular to the conditions stipulated in The Commons
Conservancy DRACC 0002. References to the Statutes or Regulations of
ToS;DR therefore automatically mean the combination of the Statutes
and Regulations of the Programme and those of The Commons Conservancy.

Any decisions made or approved by the ToS;DR Board of Directors
within the scope of its mandate will be handled according to the
procedure set out in DRACC "Decision Handling Procedure". New (versions
of) ToS;DR Statutes and Regulations enter into effect when they are
published as part of the DRACC series of The Commons Conservancy.

Financial considerations
========================

ToS;DR operates on a nil budget, which means there are no direct
financial considerations.

ToS;DR Board of Directors determines the desired direction of the
development of technology and auxiliary materials. At the request of
grantmaking organisations, donors and partners, ToS;DR MAY provide
guidance to others on and inspiration with regards to the establishment
and evaluation of activities. ToS;DR itself will have no direct
financial involvement in such activities under any circumstances.

Governance
==========

The central decision making body within ToS;DR is the ToS;DR
Board of Directors (in short: ToS;DR Board). The ToS;DR Board is
a meritocratic committee responsible for making and coordinating
decisions on behalf of the user and developer community around
ToS;DR, according to the conditions set forth in these Statutes as
well as any Regulations established by prior decisions of the ToS;DR
Board.

The ToS;DR Board has a minimum of three, and a maximum of ten
natural persons. The founding ToS;DR Board has appointed a number of
its constituting Directors to serve a half (12 month) term, and the
remainder to serve a regular (24 month) term. Subsequent Directors are
elected by the ToS;DR Board to regular 24 month terms according to
the procedure set out in these Statutes. Directors are permitted to seek
office for multiple terms, however, when running against other
candidates the amount of terms they have consecutively served is
deducted from the votes cast in their favour. This provides a balance
between continuity, equal opportunities and renewal of qualities and
competences.

The ToS;DR Board determines the Programme's structure and processes,
and is responsible for maintaining its Statutes and Regulations. The
ToS;DR Board is free to make or revise any decision, taking into
consideration applicable law as well as any immutable conditions
previously established within the Statutes or Regulations.

In order to efficiently fulfill its tasks, the Board may establish
specialized committees and taskforces, as well as assign named roles to
qualified individuals to provide advice and assistance on specific
issues. The associated qualifications, tasks and responsibilities SHALL
be formalised by publication as part of the Regulations of ToS;DR.

The ToS;DR Board (and any person, group or organisation mandated by
the ToS;DR Board on its behalf) must act in good faith and in the
common interest of the developer community and the wider user community
of ToS;DR. If significant harm to the organization has been
committed by any Director, he or she MAY be removed from the Board by a
simple majority vote of the rest of the Board.

The ToS;DR Board SHALL convene offline or online at least every
twelve (12) months.

Voting procedure
================

Any two ToS;DR Directors MAY jointly organise a vote of the
ToS;DR Board on any subject, after which a notification SHALL be
sent out by email to each Director detailing the proposed action and the
deadline.

Each Director is entitled to one (1) vote on each matter submitted to a
vote. Voting happens through an electronic voting system, by email vote
or by a quorate (online) meeting. A quorum is reached when all Directors
are either (tele)present, have appointed a proxy or have indicated they
will abstain from voting.

It is the responsibility of each Director to maintain valid contact
details for communication within the Board. When a Director does not
respond to multiple communication requests or invitations to vote for a
period of one month across at least two different channels, he or she is
removed from the quorum count until contact is restored.

Regular decisions of the ToS;DR Board are taken by a simple
majority. Any amendment to these Statutes requires a consensus of the
entire ToS;DR Board minus one Director. In all cases, the Chair of
the ToS;DR board casts the deciding vote in case of a tie.

Each Director agrees to use his best efforts to resolve disputes in an
informal manner.

Integrity
=========

All ToS;DR Directors (as well as any persons the ToS;DR Board
have delegated tasks and/or responsibilities to) are understood to act
as fiduciaries with regard to the ToS;DR Programme, and their duties
include, but are not limited to, the fiduciary duty of care and the
fiduciary duty of loyalty.

Directors SHOULD NOT receive any personal benefit as a result of a
pending decision -- he or she is required to explain the circumstances
and avoid taking any part in the decision.

Any conflict of interest or apparent conflict of interest between
ToS;DR and individual Directors MUST be avoided. Directors undertake
to declare any interest in any item under discussion and MAY be invited
by the ToS;DR Chair to withdraw from discussions when business
concerning their personal interests or the interests of natural or legal
persons close to them is being dealt with. Directors MUST heed such an
invitation and at the very least abstain from voting.

Decisions involving activities under which one or more Directors would
have conflicts of interest that are of material significance to the
Programme and/or to the relevant Director(s) require the approval of the
entire ToS;DR Board minus the Director(s) with a conflict of
interest.

Licensing policy
================

All software and content created or maintained within ToS;DR is to
be made publically available perpetually at no cost under one or more of
the licenses on the Free Software Foundation's list of "recommended
copyleft licenses" or any license approved by the Open Source Initiative
on or after the submission date.

When additional licensing needs (which would make the identical software
or assets available also through licenses not on those lists) arise, the
ToS;DR Board is responsible for deciding on a case by case basis how
this shall be best dealt with. In such matters the Board SHALL act in
the common interest of the user and developer community, respectful of
the spirit and intents of the original creators of and contributors to
ToS;DR.

Any financial benefits resulting from licensing agreements with third
parties shall exclusively be directed towards a not-for-profit
organisation aligned with the goals of ToS;DR as contribution to the
future development and maintenance of ToS;DR. These contributions
shall be spent under the responsibility of the ToS;DR Board, on
behalf of the ToS;DR user and developer community and in the general
public interest.
